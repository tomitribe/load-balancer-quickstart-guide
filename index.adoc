= Load Balance Microservices
Time: 15 minutes

Learning objectives

* What are and how to create an API connection.
* Add Round Robin load balance to an API connection.
* Create a Route that uses the Load Balance API connection.
* Test the Route to validate the Load Balance API connection accessing the microservices.

Prerequisites

* Docker installed and the daemon is running on your computer.
* Internet connection.
* Curl installed on your computer.


=== 1. Run the demo Microservices
image::demo-diagram.png[]

For this guide we are going to scale the movie microservice to three instances with a custom language configuration: English, Spanish and French.

Each client request to obtain the microservice Language Configuration is going to be Load balanced by the Tribestream API Gateway.

In order to run our demo microservices we need to open a terminal and execute the following command:
```
docker run -e LANG=ENGLISH -d -p 3333:9090 --name movie-api-en  tomitribedev/movie-api
docker run -e LANG=SPANISH -d -p 4444:9090 --name movie-api-es  tomitribedev/movie-api
docker run -e LANG=FRENCH -d -p 5555:9090 --name movie-api-fr  tomitribedev/movie-api
```

We can validate that our microservices are up and running by executing the following commands.
Notice that each  microservice returns in the payload it’s own Language Configuration.

```
curl  http://localhost:3333/movie-api/api/language
"ENGLISH"
curl  http://localhost:4444/movie-api/api/language
"SPANISH"
curl  http://localhost:5555/movie-api/api/language
"FRENCH"
```


=== 2. Run Tribestream API Gateway (TAG)
We can reuse the TAG docker container we created from preivous guides by executing the following command:

```
docker start tag
```

* If this is the first time you run TAG, open a terminal execute the following command according to your operating
  system:
    ** For linux:
	`docker run --net="host" -de LICENSE=accept --name tag tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway
 tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway`

    ** For OS X and Windows:
     `docker run -de LICENSE=accept --name tag -p 8080:8080  tomitribe/tribestream-api-gateway`

To see the TAG starting process log you can execute the following command:
```
docker logs -f tag
```

TAG is ready when you see the following message on the TAG log:

```
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["http-bio-8080"]
INFO [main] org.apache.coyote.AbstractProtocol.start Starting ProtocolHandler ["ajp-bio-8009"]
INFO [main] org.apache.catalina.startup.Catalina.start Server startup in 18348 ms
```

To exit the log view, you need to type `crtl+c` on the terminal.

=== 3.  Login into TAG
Open a browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:8080/tag`

Login into the TAG dashboard using the following credentials: username: `admin`, password: `admin`.
If this is not the first time you are login into TAG, you may be redirected straight to the `Dashboard` page.

=== 4. Load Balance your microservices
==== 4.1 Create an API Connection

image::api-connection-diagram.png[]

`Connections` is the term Tribestream API Gateway uses to describe and configure external resources like Databases,
Ldap servers and API’s.  The following instructions will provide you the steps need it to create and `API connection`
to describe and configure the access to the three microservices we previously started.

From the TAG `Dashboard` page click on the `Connections` option to navigate to the `Connections` page, click the `+`
button on the upper right side and select `API Connection`.

image::open-new-connections.gif[]

Create a new `API Connection`  with the following data according to your Operating System and then click the `Save` button.

* Name: load balance api connection
* Location:
    ** For linux:  `http://localhost:3333`
    ** For OS X and Windows: `http://host.docker.internal:3333`



==== 4.2 Add Load Balancing to an API Connection
In the `Load Balance API` Connection detail page, click the `…` button and select `Add Load Balancing`.

image::open-load-balancing.png["", 600,409 ]

The `Load Balancing` section appears. To add the remaining two microservice endpoints location, click the the Host `+`
button and add the two locations, then click the `save` button located at the top right corner of the screen:

    * For linux: `http://localhost:4444 and http://localhost:5555`
    * For OS X and Windows: `http://host.docker.internal:4444 and http://host.docker.internal:5555`

==== 4.3 Create a Route to reference the Load Balanced API Connection
image::route-lb-diagram.png[]

The mechanism used by the Tribestream API Gateway to orchestrate and secure the traffic to and from API endpoints is called `Route`.

For the purpose of this guide, you need to create a Route in order to use the Load Balancer created
in the previous step via the `API Connection`.

From the `Dashboard` page, click the `Route` link and then from the `Routes` page click the `+` button on the upper right
side and select` Mod_Rewrite Route`.

image::open-new-route.gif[]

Create a new Route with the following data and click `Save`:

* Name: `Load Balancer Route`
* Mod_Rewrite: `RewriteRule "^/?test-load-balancer$" "%{API:load balance api connection}/movie-api/api/language" [P,NE]`

image::create-route.png[]



=== 5. Test the Load Balancer Route
image::test-lb-diagram.png[]

To successfully test the load balance microservice we can send a couple of request
to the `test-load-balancer` endpoint that TAG now provides by the route we created.
Notice that TAG is going to apply the `mod_rewrite` rule and will proxy the requests to the microservice `/language` endpoint.


To successfully test the load balance microservice you can execute the following command three times to see how the
microservices are effectively balanced:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"ENGLISH"
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"SPANISH"
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"FRENCH"
```

You can now shutdown one of the microservice by execute the following command:
```
docker stop movie-api-en
```

Run again  three times and see how the microservices are effectively balanced:
```
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"SPANISH"
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"FRENCH"
curl http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer
"SPANISH"
```

You can start again the `movie-api-en` microservice:
```
docker start movie-api-en
```

=== 6. Disabling a specific microservice via TAG Load Balancer UI
You can also deactivate  one of the three microservices using the TAG UI. 
From the TAG `Dashboard` page click on the `Connections` option and click 
the `load balance api connection` we previously created.

image::disable-one-endpoint.gif[]

Just like in the previous section, now you can run again three times the curl command making a request to
`http://localhost:8080/test-load-balancer` and see how the two microservices are effectively balanced now that one of
the three was deactivated via the TAG UI.




=== 7. Stop Tribestream API Gateway
Since both the TAG and the microservices were created with a specific container name, you can now stop the
containers from the command line with the following command.

Stopping TAG
```
docker stop tag
```

Stopping the microservices
```
docker stop movie-api-en
docker stop movie-api-es
docker stop movie-api-fr
```
